## What is Marketing Analytics?
Marketing analytics is the study of data to evaluate the performance of a marketing activity. By applying technology and analytical processes to marketing-related data, businesses can understand what drives consumer actions, refine their marketing campaigns, and optimise their return on investment.

## Project Overview:
The project revolves around analyzing data from a leading online marketplace in India to visualize and improve business performance through data-driven insights. 
The objective is to provide actionable recommendations based on thorough analysis of customer behavior, seller dynamics, product trends, and channel performance. The project spans data from September 2016 to October 2018 and employs advanced analytics tools including PySpark, AWS S3, Databricks, SQL, and Python.

## Data Description:
The dataset encompasses critical tables including Customers, Sellers, Products, Orders, Order Items, Order Payments, Order Review Ratings, and Geo-Location. These tables offer detailed information crucial for understanding customer preferences, optimizing seller strategies, and identifying growth opportunities across different product categories and geographic regions.
The project involved uploading data to s3, extracting data from an Amazon S3 bucket and seamlessly integrating it into the Databricks environment. This was achieved by mounting the S3 bucket onto the Databricks platform, enabling smooth access and interaction with the data stored in S3.

## Deliverables:
1. Cleaned and processed dataset ready for analysis and visualization written to S3
2. Insights into customer behaviors, seller performance, and product trends.
3. Presentation of findings and recommendations to stakeholders using Databricks dashboards: https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/7779950145079196/2562618158196569/8306412094830006/latest.html
